            <h1>Backend.</h1>
            <p>
                We all have one and some like to <em>work</em> it, but a few even work <em>with</em> it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here we'll talk a bit about backend in the context of programming.
                What it is, how it's helpful and who it might be for.

            <h2>What is backend?</h2>
            <p>
                Backend is the foundation for data.
                It's the terminology used to describe the <em>data access layer</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A typical backend is comprised of databases; data to be used by various functions and applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                One example of this would be a database storing login information, and instructions on how to access that information.
            </p>

            <h2>How is backend helpful?</h2>
            <p>
                Backend is helpful for any system in need to store, modify or access data on regular basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's very helpful if you have a lot of information that may be accessed only when needed or in specific manners.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="who">
            <h2>Who may backend be for?</h2>
            <p>
                For those who like <em>structure and tidiness</em>, backend will suit your style.
                If you're someone who like or need to <em>gather and use</em> a lot of data, backend will make your life easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples of popular backend programming languages are Java, C#, and Python.
